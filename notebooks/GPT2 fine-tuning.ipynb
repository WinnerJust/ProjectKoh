This is done intentionally in order to keep readers familiar with my format.*\n\n<br>\n\nThis notebook is used to fine-tune GPT2 model for text classification using [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library on a custom dataset.\n\nHugging Face is very nice to us to include all the functionality needed for GPT2 to be used in classification tasks. Thank you Hugging Face!\n\nI wasn't able to find much information on how to use GPT2 for classification so I decided to make this tutorial using similar structure with other transformers models.\n\n**Main idea:**\nSince GPT2 is a decoder transformer, the last token of the input sequence is used to make predictions about the next token that should follow the input. This means that the last token of the input sequence contains all the information needed in the prediction. With this in mind we can use that information to make a prediction in a classification task instead of generation task.\n\nIn other words, instead of using first token embedding to make prediction like we do in Bert, we will use the last token embedding to make prediction with GPT2.\n\nSince we only cared about the first token in Bert, we were padding to the right. Now in GPT2 we are using the last token for prediction so we will need to pad on the left. Because of a nice upgrade to HuggingFace Transformers we are able to configure the GPT2 Tokenizer to do just that.\n\n\n<br>\n\n## **What should I know for this notebook?**\n\nSince I am using PyTorch to fine-tune our transformers models any knowledge on PyTorch is very useful.\n\nKnowing a little bit about the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library helps too.\n\n<br>\n\n## **How to use this notebook?**\n\n\nLike with every project, I built this notebook with reusability in mind.\n\nAll changes will happen in the data processing part where you need to customize the PyTorch Dataset, Data Collator and DataLoader to fit your own data needs.\n\nAll parameters that can be changed are under the **Imports** section. Each parameter is nicely commented and structured to be as intuitive as possible.\n\n<br>\n\n## **Dataset**\n\nThis notebook will cover pretraining transformers on a custom dataset. I will use the well known movies reviews positive - negative labeled [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).\n\nThe description provided on the Stanford website:\n\n*This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well. Raw text and already processed bag of words formats are provided. See the README file contained in the release for more details.*\n\n**Why this dataset?** I believe is an easy to understand and use dataset for classification. I think sentiment data is always fun to work with.\n\n<br>\n\n## **Coding**\n\nNow let's do some coding! We will go through each coding cell in the notebook and describe what it does, what's the code, and when is relevant - show the output.\n\nI made this format to be easy to follow if you decide to run each code cell in your own python notebook.\n\nWhen I learn from a tutorial I always try to replicate the results. I believe it's easy to follow along if you have the code next to the explanations.\n\n<br>\n","metadata":{"id":"6oaNu3HJtTTo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Downloads**\n\nDownload the *Large Movie Review Dataset* and unzip it locally.\n","metadata":{"id":"78UA1RvdxDTp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# download the dataset\n#!wget -q -nc http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz\n# unzip it\n#!tar -zxf /content/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz","metadata":{"id":"zB6DIS61xE2j","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-28T19:24:06.381959Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-28T19:24:06.382221Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-28T19:24:06.385830Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-28T19:24:06.382199Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-28T19:24:06.384923Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Installs**\n\n* **[transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)** library needs to be installed to use all the awesome code from Hugging Face.

We need this class to read in our dataset, parse it and return texts with their associated labels.\n\nIn this class I only need to read in the content of each file, use fix_text to fix any Unicode problems and keep track of positive and negative sentiments.\n\nI will append all texts and labels in lists.\n\nThere are three main parts of this PyTorch Dataset class:\n\n* **init()** where we read in the dataset and transform text and labels into numbers.\n* **len()** where we need to return the number of examples we read in. This is used when calling len(MovieReviewsDataset()).\n* **getitem()** always takes as an input an int value that represents which example from our examples to return from our dataset. If a value of 3 is passed, we will return the example form our dataset at position 3.\n\n<br>\n\n**Gpt2ClassificationCollator**\n\nI use this class to create the Data Collator. This will be used in the DataLoader to create the bathes of data that get fed to the model. I use the tokenizer and label encoder on each sequence to convert texts and labels to number.\n\nLucky for us, Hugging Face thought of everything and made the tokenizer do all the heavy lifting (split text into tokens, padding, truncating, encode text into numbers) and is very easy to use!\n\nThere are two main parts of this Data Collator class:\n\n* **init()** where we initialize the tokenizer we plan to use, how to encode our labels and if we need to set the sequence length to a different value.\n\n* **__call__()** used as function collator that takes as input a batch of data examples. It needs to return an object with the format that can be fed to our model. Luckily our tokenizer does that for us and returns a dictionary of variables ready to be fed to the model in this way: `model(**inputs)`. Since we are fine-tuning the model I also included the labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n**train(dataloader, optimizer_, scheduler_, device_)**\n\nI created this function to perform a full pass through the DataLoader object (the DataLoader object is created from our Dataset* type object using the **MovieReviewsDataset class). This is basically one epoch train through the entire dataset.\n\nThe dataloader is created from PyTorch DataLoader which takes the object created from MovieReviewsDataset class and puts each example in batches. This way we can feed our model batches of data!\n\nThe optimizer_ and scheduler_ are very common in PyTorch. They are required to update the parameters of our model and update our learning rate during training. There is a lot more than that but I won't go into details. This can actually be a huge rabbit hole since A LOT happens behind these functions that we don't need to worry. Thank you PyTorch!\n\nIn the process we keep track of the actual labels and the predicted labels along with the loss.\n\n<br>\n\n**validation(dataloader, device_)**\n\nI implemented this function in a very similar way as train but without the parameters update, backward pass and gradient decent part. We don't need to do all of those VERY computationally intensive tasks because we only care about our model's predictions.\n\nI use the DataLoader in a similar way as in train to get out batches to feed to our model.\n\nIn the process I keep track of the actual labels and the predicted labels along with the loss.\n","metadata":{"id":"OdnKsoFbt1Wd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def convert_to_title_case(name):\n    words = name.split('_')\n    words[0] = words[0].capitalize()\n    return ' '.join(words)\n\nprint(convert_to_title_case(\"nodal_skin_eruptions\"))\nprint(convert_to_title_case(\"itching\"))","metadata":{"id":"Ssc__CmwLzXq","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-11-28T19:25:46.431413Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-11-28T19:25:46.432001Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-11-28T19:25:46.438062Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-11-28T19:25:46.431973Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-11-28T19:25:46.437009Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Nodal skin eruptions\nItching\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class MovieReviewsDataset(Dataset):\n  r\"\"\"PyTorch Dataset class for loading data.\n\n  This is where the data parsing happens.\n\n  This class is built with reusability in mind: it can be used as is as.\n\n  Arguments:\n\n    path (:obj:`str`):\n        Path to the data partition.\n\n  \"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(self, path, use_tokenizer):\n\n    # Check if path exists.\n    if not os.path.isdir(path):\n      # Raise error if path is invalid.\n      raise ValueError('Invalid `path` variable!

This is the most essential part of this tutorial since GPT2 uses the last token for prediction so we need to pad to the left.\n\nHuggingFace already did most of the work for us and added a classification layer to the GPT2 model.

**Final Note**\n\nIf you made it this far **Congrats!** 🎊 and **Thank you!** 🙏 for your interest in my tutorial!\n\nI've been using this code for a while now and I feel it got to a point where is nicely documented and easy to follow.\n\nOf course is easy for me to follow because I built it. That is why any feedback is welcome and it helps me improve my future tutorials!\n\nIf you see something wrong please let me know by opening an issue on my [ml_things GitHub repository](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/issues)!\n\nA lot of tutorials out there are mostly a one-time thing and are not being maintained. I plan on keeping my tutorials up to date as much as I can.\n\n## **Contact** 🎣\n\n🦊 GitHub: [gmihaila](https://github.com/gmihaila)\n\n🌐 Website: [gmihaila.github.io](https://gmihaila.github.io/)\n\n👔 LinkedIn: [mihailageorge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihailageorge/)\n\n📓 Medium: [@gmihaila](https://gmihaila.medium.com)\n\n📬 Email: [georgemihaila@my.unt.edu.com](mailto:georgemihaila@my.unt.edu.com?subject=GitHub%20Website)\n","metadata":{"id":"aVNtTAhV8AVg"}}]}
